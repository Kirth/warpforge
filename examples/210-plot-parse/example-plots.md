Example Plots (dummy data)
==========================

This document contains a bunch of "plot" documents, in JSON encoding.

They're all full of dummy data.
(The plots are not expected to be executable or refer to data that exists.)
They're just for asserting that the API parsers and serializers work.

These documents should all round-trip.
